URL
	pros
		With just the URL, it's possible to see what version the user is using
	
	cons
		User might try to change the URL, and might get it wrong
		URLs then get stale

Headers
	pros
		keeps your URL and body "cleaner"; "hides" the version from the user
	
	cons
		harder to code, since you need code to set the header (can't use a regular GET browser request)

Body
	pros
		keep adding more information to the entity as needed
	
	cons
		Must have entities aware of api versions, even though that isn't user data
		Must read the JSON stream in order to get the api-version
		
		
What does api-version look like?
